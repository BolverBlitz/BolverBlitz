### Archived
All archived repositories are dead and i'll not respond to any request / concern you might have

---

*Dead means: I've not written a single message on the social media apps i used last and i've not spend a single currency for 7 days. I can obvialy set a custom date in case i'm going on a vacation.
This system runs on several servers which are prepaid 3-6 months and in a privat repositoy as action. So it should work in any case.

**I have no control what this person will do, but i don't have to care either :D
